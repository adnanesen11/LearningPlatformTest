AI Interview System TODOs
=========================

1. Require camera and microphone
   - Validate camera is visible / video track is live.
   - Require camera + mic permissions before enabling "Start Interview".

2. Header branding
   - Add Cleartalent logo in the top-left.
   - Add "AI-Powered Interview System" subtitle under the logo.

3. Interview lifecycle / controls
   - Remove the End Interview button from the UI.
   - End interviews automatically using wrap-up logic instead of manual click.
   - At the start of the 15th minute, have the AI begin wrapping up (no summarization, just natural closing and final questions).
   - If the candidate exits the interview early (tab close / disconnect), mark the session as "incomplete".

4. Candidate identification
   - Require candidate First name, Last name, and Email before starting the interview.
   - Candidate name is not important for logic, but should be stored for display/reporting.

5. Admin / first screen view
   - On the first/admin screen, show a list of completed interviews.
   - Include: job title, candidate name, transcript link, recording link, status (completed/incomplete), and rating.
   - Make the list searchable/filterable (e.g., by job title, date, status).

6. Transcript, recording, and analysis
   - Save full transcript when the interview ends.
   - Save audio recording(s) for the interview (candidate + assistant, or mixed).
   - After interview completion, run LLM-based candidate analysis and rating.
   - Store analysis results with the session for later review.

7. Token usage and cost controls
   - Implement client-side token counter using `response.done` and `conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed` usage fields.
   - Log per-turn and per-session token totals for both conversation and transcription.
   - Consider persisting token totals per session on the server.
   - Add options to switch between `gpt-realtime` and `gpt-realtime-mini` to manage cost.
   - Configure truncation / context limits to bound token usage.
